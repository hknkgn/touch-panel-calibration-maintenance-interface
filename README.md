These applications are a project made during the internship.

This project is an interface project that provides calibration between the computer in the ground station and the tablets with an interface that assists the use of the UAV, and enables some technical operations to be performed.

Thus, tasks related to the tablet can be performed from the ground station computer without accessing the tablet.
